    <h3>Educator Credentials</h3>

    <p>My name is <b>Reed Esslinger</b>, and I am a network engineer with 17 years of experience. I
    have written Guides, RCAs, and runbooks for technical analysis. I
    designed learning modules for <em>technical</em> applications, managed services, and
    created a support operations standardization specification. I managed projects,
    implemented changes, investigated high-level outages in a 3-tiered environment, and
    utilized common and uncommon tools in the administration of networked computing
    environments. I have experience with both commercial off-the-shelf hardware and
    software, as well as <em>specialized</em> applications in an enterprise environment. I have over 3
    years of experience in network-cloud operations, including deployment and design. I have
    worked with the most notable companies in the industry including IBM and Microsoft.</p> 
    
    <p> I have 10 industry certifications, including an A+, Network+, Security+, Cloud+, CySA+, AZ900, ITIL Foundations and a bachelor's degree in information systems.
    I'm currently working on a Masters in Instructional Design. This site is
    a presentation of some of my work in the educational technology space.</p>
