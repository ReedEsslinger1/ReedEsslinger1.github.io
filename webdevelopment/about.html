    designed learning modules for <em>technical</em> applications, managed services, and
    created a support operations standardization specification. I managed projects,
    implemented changes, investigated high-level outages in a 3-tiered environment, and
    utilized common and uncommon tools in the administration of networked computing
    environments. <br>I have experience with both commercial off-the-shelf hardware and
    software, as well as <em>specialized</em> applications in an enterprise environment. I have over 3
    years of experience in network-cloud operations, including deployment and design. I have
    worked with the most notable companies in the industry including IBM and Microsoft.</p>
