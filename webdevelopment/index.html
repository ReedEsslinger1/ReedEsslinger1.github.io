        <h3>A Network Engineer and Educator</h3>
    <p>This page is a demonstration of my capabilities in the field of education and network
engineering. The following site provides an outline of materials I have created as part of my education in instructional
design, the networking world, and my private accomplishments. <br> You may navigate to projects at the top of the screen and see some of the learning games I've created, as well as course materials I've created for cybersecurity education. Some are proofs and others complete works.</p>
