        <h3>A Reflection</h3>

        <p> My goal is to build games and learning modules for cyber-security that are not only
        interactive but engaging. I want it to be said of my work that it was useful, and influential in
        the education of those who engage in the training I provide. My body of work continues to
        grow, but I want to know if the work I provide is useful and isnâ€™t numbered among the
        detritus that is churned out by the industry that surrounds IT and security. I continue to
        refine my work, and I accept all criticisms.</p>

        <p>My work has thus far surrounded network-specific materials with cloud computing
        emphasis, but as AI continues to change the industry, I want to leverage those capabilities
        as I continue to work and integrate those capabilities into the training I produce. The world
        of instructional design will be furthered and expanded by AI generated content. Those who
        understand this now will be better positioned to offer quality materials later.</p>

        <p>Cyber security at this point is a glut of companies that are hardly tech companies offering
        themselves as a cheap offering to the most willing buyers, and I find that professionally
        shameful. My career goals are more focused around established companies with
        established product offerings that are real. I have been a network engineer for 17 years and
        I want to expand into a role more aligned with solutions development and course offerings
        for technically challenging roles.</p>

        <p>I have done some work in researching the efficacy of certifications, and I will also expand
        into that area to make a meaningful study of the certifications free of the influence of the
        certification industry. Much of that world has been plagued by the interests of an industry
        more concerned with the profitability of certification rather than its usefulness to the
        consumer. I hope this changes.</p>
