        <h3>A Reflection</h3>

        <p> My goal is to build games and learning modules for cyber-security that are not only
        interactive but also engaging. I want it to be said of my work that it is useful, and influential in
        the education space. There are many useful publications in the tech space that are utilized, refined,
        and overall relevant in the space. I continue to refine my own body of work to that end, and I accept useful 
        criticism to further advance my own efforts.</p>

        <p>I would describe my experience, thus far, as network-specific. I have crafted materials with a cloud computing
        emphasis, focusing on small learning modules. Currently AI is rapidly changing the industry and it's continual development
        is evidence of the direction that the cyber-security industry is headed. I want to both teach to those fundamental skills 
        required to work with AI, and leverage the capability AI has to offer integrating those capabilities into the training I 
        produce. The foreseeable future will be driven by automation and AI. Those who recognize this presently will be better 
        positioned to offer quality training materials later.</p>

        <p>I must admit that cyber security seems inundated in stale offerings, not just in terms of training, but in the quality
        of many organizations in the space. There is no want for companies that exist with the stated goal of ending their existence in 
        an asset management portfolio, or organizations being brought to ruin by a lack of process, procedure, or documentation. My career 
        goals are mostly focused around building out the educational, and technical knowledge bases of established companies seeking
        truly competitive success that goes beyond simple solutions architecting.</p>

        <p>Certifications alone do not address the needs of a technical work environment, and it has been my observation that technical 
        knowledge alone does not guarantee a productive and functional workforce. The internal requirements of an organization can often 
        present challenges as no two organizations are the same. No set of processes and procedures can be shared between any two 
        organizations. I can create the trainings that fill this gap, analyzing the needs of an organization and architecting a learning 
        experience tailored to those unique challenges that an organization may face has been my stated goal.</p>
